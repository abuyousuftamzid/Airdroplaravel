- ✅ **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs

## Database Schema
The implementation uses existing database tables:
- `packages` - Main package data
- `shipping_rates` - Dynamic shipping configuration
- `orders` - Integration with order system
- `documents` - File storage metadata
- `users` - Customer and employee data

## Configuration
Shipping rates are configurable via the `shipping_rates` table:
- `insurance_rate` - Insurance calculation rate
- `fuel_surcharge` - Fuel surcharge amount
- `incorrect_shipping_info` - Additional charge for incorrect info
- `half_lb_rate` - Rate for packages ≤ 0.5 lbs
- `first_lb_rate` - Rate for first pound
- `additional_lb_rate` - Rate for additional pounds (2-20 lbs)
- `over_twenty_lb_rate` - Rate for packages > 20 lbs

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to **Packages** → **Create Package** in the admin sidebar
2. Enter courier tracking number (auto-searches existing packages)
3. Enter customer account number (auto-populates customer info)
4. Select shipping method (Air/Express/Seadrop)
5. Fill in package details based on selected method
6. Upload invoice documents if available
7. Submit to create package

### For Developers
- **Package Service**: Use `App\Modules\Admin\Services\PackageService` for business logic
- **Shipping Calculations**: Modify rates in `shipping_rates` table
- **File Uploads**: Stored in `storage/app/public/package_documents`
- **Tracking Codes**: Auto-generated with format `AIR[8CHARS][3DIGITS]`

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all three shipping methods with various weights/dimensions
2. Verify courier number lookup with existing and new packages
3. Test customer account validation
4. Upload various file types and sizes
5. Test form validation with invalid data
6. Verify calculations match original PHP implementation

## Future Enhancements
- Package status tracking workflow
- Email notifications to customers
- Bulk package operations
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with carrier APIs
- Mobile app support
